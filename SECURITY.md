# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, only the version on the `default` branch will receive security fixes.
This will be the policy until version 1.0. Then, the most recent 1.x version
will receive security updates.

Once we reach version 2.0, at least one previous major version will continue to
receive security updates.
